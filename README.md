# Rainer Studhalter

This is the repo for my personal website @ [studhalter.dev](https://studhalter.dev/).

I publish the source code for the following purposes:

- kickstart your own project
- for your inspiration
- show my coding skills
- refer to code in my blog

You can use the code as you wish, just make sure to cleanup my personal details and images if you publish anything based on this repo.

## Setup

```bash
project_name=domain.tld
git clone https://github.com/rainerstudhalter/studhalter.dev.git $project_name
cd $project_name
npm install

# start dev server and go to http://localhost:5173
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Todo

- Contact: server side lang
- LightSwitch

## License
Currently UNLICENSED.

I want the code to be licensed under MIT, but exclude personal details (name, address, images, etc...), my previous employers and that sort of content from being covered by the MIT license.

Maybe someone can help me figure out on how to implement this.
